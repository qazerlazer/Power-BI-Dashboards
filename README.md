### Problem Statement : 
I developed an interactive dashboard for a mock company to track and analyze key performance metrics, including total revenue, sales quantity, revenue by market, sales quantity by market, top 5 customers, and top 5 products. This dashboard allows users to filter data by year or even down to specific months, making it easy to identify revenue trends over time. The tool helps the company better understand customer behavior and market dynamics, enabling more informed decision-making. By highlighting high-performing products and customer segments, the dashboard provides actionable insights that support strategic planning and performance improvement.
